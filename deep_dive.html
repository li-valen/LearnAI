            <p id="what-actually-paragraph-2">Everything AI does is based on numbers. It converts images, videos, audios into numbers. And this allows the AI to see things the way us humans see things. AI models go through thousands of trial and error rounds before being able to predict on new images and videos.</p>

            <p id="how-made-paragraph-1">The AI that you and I use such as Siri and google assistant and a lot of other AIâ€™s like ChatGPT or Googles Bart are all large models. These models are millions of connections that build the models memory and its ability to think of new things.  </p>

            <p id="how-made-paragraph-2">
              These models are like the neurons in our brains, they allow the model to build strong neural connections. These models are trained in a series of trial and error simulations called 
epochs.

            <p id="how-made-paragraph-3">
              Each epoch represent are number of trial and error simulations where the model is trying to learn about the dat you are feeding to it. If its images, it breaks down the images to numbers and then learns and predicts what it is.  </p>
