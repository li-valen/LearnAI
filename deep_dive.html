        <h1>What actually is AI?</h1>
        <p>AI is trying to mimic the way humans think and act, but with a computer. The AI is a series of neural networks (which are like the neurons in our brains) and complex statistical computations that allow it to understand what we say and see. </p>

    <h1>Everything AI does is based on numbers. It converts images, videos, audios into numbers. And this allows the AI to see things the way us humans see things. AI models go through thousands of trial and error rounds before being able to predict on new images and videos.</h1>
