              John McCarthy, born in 1927, played a pivotal role in the history of artificial intelligence. In 1956, he coined the term "artificial intelligence," igniting a revolution in computer science. His contributions, including the development of the LISP programming language, laid the groundwork for countless advancements in AI research.
          </h3>
          <h3 id="history-p-2">
            McCarthy's vision extended beyond terminology; he also introduced the concept of time-sharing systems, revolutionizing computer access. His belief in AI as a field capable of mimicking human intelligence inspired decades of research and innovation. Today, his legacy remains influential, shaping the trajectory of artificial intelligence since its inception.
